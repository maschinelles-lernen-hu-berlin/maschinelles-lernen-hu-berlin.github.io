Our work ranges from basic research in computational linguistics to key applications in human language technology, and covers areas such as sentence understanding, automatic question answering, machine translation, syntactic parsing and tagging, sentiment analysis, dialogue agents, and moodels of text and visual scenes, as well as applications of natural language processing to the digital humanities and computational social sciences.

A distinguishing feature of the Stanford NLP Group is our effective combination of sophisticated and deep linguistic modeling and data analysis with innovative probabilistic, machine learning, and deep learning approaches to NLP. Our research has resulted in state-of-the-art technology for robust, broad-coverage natural-language processing in a number of languages.

We are regularly searching for people interested in doing their thesis at our group. Reach out to us if you're interested.
