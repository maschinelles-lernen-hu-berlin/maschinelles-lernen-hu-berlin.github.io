Hi, I’m Felix :wave: <br>

I’m a visiting researcher in the [Machine Learning group](https://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/en/forschung-en/gebiete/ml-en/ml) at the Humboldt University of Berlin. Here, I am investigating how we can improve the fine-tuning efficiency of machine learning methods, e.g., so that language models such as BERT need only little training data and still achieve high classification performance. I’m also a research group leader at the [Heidelberg Academy of Sciences](https://www.hadw-bw.de/en/junge-wissenschaft/win-kolleg-0/Teilprogramm7/fake-news), where we are using such models to automatically identify media bias in news articles.
