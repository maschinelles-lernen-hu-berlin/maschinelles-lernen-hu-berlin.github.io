Welcome to the Machine Learning Group of the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin! 

Our goal is to give machines the ability to understand and use human language. To this end, we research new approaches for **machine learning** (ML) and **natural language processing (NLP)**, and develop the open source [Flair framework]() for automated text analysis.


Find out more about our team, our [research](publication) and our [teaching](teaching).

_**Open Positions:** Our group is growing quickly so we are always looking for PhD candidates and student assistants to join our group!_
