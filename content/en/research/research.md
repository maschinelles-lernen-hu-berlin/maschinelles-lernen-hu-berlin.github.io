The key questions of our research are how to model and extract general, linguistic world knowledge from large amounts of text data, and how to apply this knowledge to solve tasks that require human-like language intelligence.

We currently have **7 running research projects**: 4 DFG-funded projects, including an Emmy Noether research group, and 3 industry collaborations.
