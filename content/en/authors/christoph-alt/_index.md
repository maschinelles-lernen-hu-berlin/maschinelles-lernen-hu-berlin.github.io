Hi, I'm Christoph :wave: <br>

I'm a postdoc in the [Machine Learning group](https://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/en/forschung-en/gebiete/ml-en/ml) at Humboldt University of Berlin, headed by [Prof. Alan Akbik](http://alanakbik.github.io/). I'm also a member of the DFG-funded excellence cluster [Science of Intelligence](https://www.scienceofintelligence.de/about-us/).

Previously, I was a postdoc (senior researcher) and doctoral student in the [speech and language technology group](https://dfki-nlp.github.io/) at the German Research Center for AI (DFKI), supervised by [Prof. Sebastian MÃ¶ller](https://www.qu.tu-berlin.de/menue/team/professur/parameter/en/) and [Prof. Hans Uszkoreit](http://hans.uszkoreit.net/).
