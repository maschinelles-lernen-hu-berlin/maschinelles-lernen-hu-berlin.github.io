Hi, I'm Jonas :wave: <br>

I'm a first year PhD student in the [machine Learning group](https://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/en/forschung-en/gebiete/ml-en/ml) at Humboldt University of Berlin advised by [Alan Akbik](https://maschinelles-lernen-hu-berlin.github.io/author/alan-akbik/).
I'm part of the project [ML-ENA](https://maschinelles-lernen-hu-berlin.github.io/project/zim-ena/) funded by the [BMWi](https://www.bmwi.de/Navigation/DE/Home/home.html).

My research focuses on data-efficient learning such as neural transfer learning, zero- and few-shot learning.
