Hi, I'm Alan :wave: <br>

I am professor of machine learning at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin. My research focuses on natural language processing (NLP), i.e. methods that enable machines to understand human language. This spans research topics such as transfer learning, few-shot learning and semantic parsing, as well as application areas in large-scale text analytics. My research is operationalized in form of the open source NLP framework Flair that allows anyone to use state-of-the-art NLP methods in their research or applications. Together with my group and the open source community, we maintain and develop the Flair framework.
