TARS uses a premise-hypothesis data input structure to technically transform every text classification task into a binary label
space compared to previous models. This input structure enables TARS to train the
same model for different corpora and eliminates the need to add a custom linear layer for
each tag space. Further, this layout leverages the integration of semantic information
from the label of a concrete data point.
