Hi, I'm Franzi :wave: <br>

I’m a visiting researcher in [Prof. Alan Akbik‘s](http://alanakbik.github.io/) [Machine Learning group](https://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/en/forschung-en/gebiete/ml-en/ml) at the Humboldt University of Berlin. I’m also a part-time research assistant at the Heidelberg Academy of Sciences and I‘m connected to the [University of Konstanz](https://www.uni-konstanz.de/) by an [EXIST](https://www.exist.de/) startup funding grant. 

Previously, I was a research assistant at the [Empirical Social Research](https://www.soziologie.uni-konstanz.de/en/hinz/) chair of [Prof. Thomas Hinz](https://www.soziologie.uni-konstanz.de/hinz/team/prof-dr-thomas-hinz/), where I worked on the (semi-)automation of social science analyses.

If you share my research interests, I am also happy to supervise BA and MA projects and/or theses. Just send me an email!
