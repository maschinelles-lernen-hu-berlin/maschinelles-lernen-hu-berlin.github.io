Hi, I’m Susanna :wave: <br>

since March 2022 I'm part of the [Machine Learning group](https://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/en/forschung-en/gebiete/ml-en/ml) at Humboldt University of Berlin as a PhD student, advised by [Prof. Alan Akbik](http://alanakbik.github.io/). Coming from a linguistic background, previously I was research assistant at [JULIE Lab](https://julielab.de/About.html) in Jena.

My research focuses on neural text representations in natural language processing, in particular around their ability to structurally encode (asymmetric) semantic relations, e.g. hypernymy or meronymy. Such representations may be helpful in several downstream tasks such as textual entailment, neural search and sense disambiguation. Related to this research, I'm interested in different ways to combine the distributional knowledge from language models (such as BERT) with manual resources such as semantic databases like WordNet or gazetteers.
