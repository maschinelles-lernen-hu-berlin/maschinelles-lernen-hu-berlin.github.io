Hi, I'm Max :wave: <br>

I'm a PhD stundent in the [Machine Learning group](https://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/en/forschung-en/gebiete/ml-en/ml) at Humboldt University of Berlin, headed by Prof. Alan Akbik, and part of the project “Modeling Neurogenesis for Continuous Learning” at [Science of Intelligence](https://www.scienceofintelligence.de/).

My research concentrates on utilizing topological changes during the training of artificial neural networks. Over the course of the next years, I want to explore the impact of such changes on learning characteristics such as the ability to continually learn new tasks.
