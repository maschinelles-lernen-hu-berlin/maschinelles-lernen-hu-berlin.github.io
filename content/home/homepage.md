Welcome to the Machine Learning Group of the Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin! 

We focus on research in machine learning (ML) and **natural language processing (NLP)**. Our goal is to give machines the ability to understand and use human language. To achieve this, our group develops the [Flair framework](<>) for automated text analysis. It is already used in **hundreds of research projects and industrial applications** and is frequently listed among the most popular deep learning frameworks for NLP.

On these pages you can find information about our [research](publication), our [teaching](teaching) and the Flair framework.
